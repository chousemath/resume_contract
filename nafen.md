### Notes on Nafen

* Their asset is call ThinkCoin
* Their purpose in running an ICO is to raise funds to scale up their production facilities (add more reactors)
* How their token works is that each token is tied to a 100% discount coupon for 1g of NAFEN fiberÂ¡
* holding payments?
* If you want to actually `sell` Nafen to a buyer, you sort of create a buying order to the Nafen Company, they will buy back the tokens at market price, and then they themselves will distribute the Nafen to the buyer, in the process they will burn the token (send to a zero address)
