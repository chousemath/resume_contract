### Panel Discussion

* Middle East and Russia are not accepting blockchain technologies
* Another way to approach architecting a blockchain-based application is to do all non-essential operations off-chain, and store only the most important transaction summaries on the blockchain
* The presenters are advocating a hybrid solution for scalable, blockchain applications, keep non-essential operations and data off-chain, keep essential stuff on-chain
* In the U.S., the SEC has decided that Ethereum is NOT a security

### What is a security?

> A security is a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (via stock), a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation (represented by owning that entity's bond), or rights to ownership as represented by an option.
