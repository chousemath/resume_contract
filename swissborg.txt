SwissBorg (2018-06-28)

> Meetup on Ethereum at WeWork (Euljiro)

* Napster was the first peer to peer digital exchange
* E-Mule was a similar platform, but it was decentralized
* Tokenization, platformization, `swarm intelligence`
* There is a lot of wasted energy and resources because people in the process do not trust each other
* Blockchain will not survive without a token economy, that is why crypto-assets are so important 
* Payment tokens, utility tokens, asset-backed tokens are some examples of different categories of tokens 
* Swissborg uses the CHSB token
