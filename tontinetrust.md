Tontine Trust

> Pensions on the blockchain

* What is a `tontine`?
* The problem is, more elderly, fewer young people to support them
* Tontine is one of the oldest pension systems in the history of the world
* Tontine is the combination of a pension fund and a lottery
* Tontine is sort of like a lottery ticket that you are guaranteed to win, so long as you are alive to claim it
* The longer you live, the more valuable the tontine 
* Tontine is specific to each individual, for couples, it is in their best interest to split their funds across two tontines
