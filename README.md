### General notes on smart contracts

* Smart contracts are “immutable”. Once they are deployed, their code is impossible to change, making it impossible to fix any discovered bugs.
* Strings are considered dynamic arrays in Solidity, because we are unable to retrieve nested arrays through web3, that means we are unable to fetch arrays of strings through web3
* This contract uses IPFS for all document and image storage
